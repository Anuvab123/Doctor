Frameworks and language used:
-
Spring Boot: A popular Java-based framework for building web applications, it provides a comprehensive set of tools for building scalable and secure web applications.

MySQL: A popular open-source relational database management system, used as the database for this application.

Hibernate: A powerful and widely used Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for Java that simplifies database access.

Data Flow:
-
The Doctor Booking App uses several functions to handle the data flow and perform the necessary operations. Here are the main functions used in the application:

UserController: This controller handles all user-related requests, such as registering a new user, logging in, and logging out. It interacts with the UserService to perform the necessary operations.

UserService: This service layer handles user-related business logic, such as checking if a user exists, creating a new user, and updating user information. It interacts with the UserRepository to perform database operations.

UserRepository: This repository layer handles all database operations related to users, such as saving a new user, retrieving a user by ID, and updating user information.

DoctorController: This controller handles all doctor-related requests, such as retrieving a list of all doctors, retrieving details for a specific doctor, and booking an appointment with a doctor. It interacts with the DoctorService to perform the necessary operations.

DoctorService: This service layer handles doctor-related business logic, such as retrieving a list of all doctors, retrieving details for a specific doctor, and checking if a doctor is available for an appointment. It interacts with the DoctorRepository to perform database operations.

The Doctor Booking App uses a typical data flow for a web application and several functions to handle the data flow and perform the necessary operations. By following these best practices, the application is well-organized, easy to maintain, and scalable.

Project Summary:
-
The Doctor Booking App is a web application that allows users to book appointments with doctors. Users can register an account, browse a list of available doctors, view their profiles, and book appointments with them. The app also allows users to view their past and upcoming appointments, as well as cancel appointments if necessary.

The application is built using Spring Boot, which provides a robust framework for building web applications in Java. It uses Thymeleaf templates for rendering the user interface and MySQL as the database for storing data.
